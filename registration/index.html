    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <p>
       Specifically, the AASG workshop serves two purposes. First, the AASG workshop provides an opportunity to showcase real-world deployments of MAS research (including COVID-19 applications). More often than not, unexpected practical challenges emerge when solutions developed in the lab are deployed in the real world, which makes it challenging to utilize complex and well thought out computational/modeling advances. Learning about the challenges faced in these deployments during the workshop will help us understand lessons of moving from the lab to the real world. Second, the AASG workshop provides opportunities to showcase MAS systems which dynamically adapt to changing environments, are robust to errors in execution and planning, and handle uncertainties of different kinds that are common in the real world. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration from different communities including artificial intelligence, game theory, operations research, social science, and psychology. This workshop is structured to encourage a lively exchange of ideas between members from these communities. We encourage submissions to the workshop from: (i) computer scientists who have used (or are currently using) their MAS research to solve important real-world problems for societyâ€™s benefit in a measurable manner; (ii) interdisciplinary researchers combining MAS research with various disciplines (e.g., social science, psychology and criminology); and (iii) engineers and scientists from organizations who aim for social good, and look to build real multi-agent systems.

    <h4>Submission Details</h4>
    <p>
        EasyChair Link for Paper Submissions: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aasg2021"> Link </a><br/><br/>
        We solicit papers in two categories:<br/><br/>
        

        1. <b>Research papers</b> describing novel contributions in either the development of MAS techniques (motivated by societal applications), or their deployment in practice. Both work in progress and recently published work will be considered. Submissions describing recently published work should clearly indicate the earlier venue and provide a link to the published paper. Papers in this category should be at most 8 pages (in AAMAS format), with one additional page containing only references.<br/><br/>
        2. <b>Position papers</b> describing open problems or neglected perspectives on the field, proposing ideas for bringing MAS methods into a new application area, or summarizing the focus areas of a group working on MAS for social good. Papers in this category should be at most 4 pages (in AAMAS format), with one additional page containing only references.<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
    All papers should be submitted in AAMAS format. Accepted papers will be selected for oral and poster presentation based on peer review. Submissions are not double-blind; the submitted paper should include author names and affiliations.
